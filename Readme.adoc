= Elastic Example

This example spins up empty Elasticsearch and Neo4j database. You can get both systems started, by running the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:neo4j-examples/elastic-example.git
cd elastic-example
docker-compose up
```

You can load the accounts.json file from the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-index.html[Getting Started with Elasticsearch^] guide by running the following command:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST "localhost:9200/bank/_bulk?pretty&refresh" --data-binary "@elastic/dump/accounts.json"
```
